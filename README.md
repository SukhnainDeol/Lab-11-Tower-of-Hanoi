# Lab-11-Tower-of-Hanoi

This program solves the popular tower of hanoi problem in java using recursion. The program prompts the user for the number of disks to solve for then prints out each step.
Each steps states which disk to move to which tower from where and uses text to create a visualization of the each towers state.  

For example, here is the first step to solve for 4 disks:
